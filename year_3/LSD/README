This is my char counter for the distributed systems coursework

I created certain scripts for automation in out/production/Charcounter
	* run.sh will do all the building and start FF automatically
	* makefile has instructions on what to build and where, moving stufff and making the dev dir.

To run it is sufficient to edit the java files in source if needed, then call ./run.sh
to make dev environment, just call : make dev
