(not really helpful--> applying remove frequent) attribute selection leaves us with 14 attrs, which yields 88.6% in mlp, simple logistic 90%
	* attribute selection with geneticSearch leaves 14 attrs

varrying split also varies performance!

opt is out of the box q/ 50 folds

heuristic stop >> causes issues best so far is 10
maxBoosting iterations increased drops performance , optimal is 8 
numBoosting is also the same, 8 is good
AIC true is good
cross-valid true is good
weight-trimmed 0 is good
