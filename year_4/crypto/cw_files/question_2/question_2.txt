-- MESSAGE w/Key #33 = 'xayxayxayxayxay' ----------------
the message starts here recently hardware trojans have attracted the attention of governments and researchers one of the main concerns is that integrated circuits in military or critical infrastructure applications could be maliciously manipulated during the manufacturing process which often takes place abroad however since there have been no reported hardware trojans in practice yet little is known about how such a trojan would look like and how hard to implement one in practice one example is dopant trojan this can be used to compromise the security of a meaningful real world target while avoiding detection by functional testing as well as trojan detection mechanisms such trojans can be used to establish a hidden side channel in an otherwise side channel resistant design this trojan does not change the logic value of any gate but instead changes only the power profile of two gates an evaluator who is not aware of the trojan cannot attack the trojan design using common side channel attacks the owner of the trojan however can use his knowledge of the trojan power model to establish a hidden side channel that reliably leaks out secret keys this is the end of the message
